# CRNCH Summit Poster Session
The CRNCH Student Poster Session will be held on Feburary 2nd, 2023 from ~12 to 1:15 PM. We are excited to have a large number of posters from our CRNCH students, and we also are thrilled to be able to feature the work of some of our [CRNCH PhD Fellowship winners](https://crnch.gatech.edu/content/crnch-fellowship).

We note that in some cases, we have not linked posters due to work being under submission.
