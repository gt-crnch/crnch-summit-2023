# CRNCH Summit Poster Session
The CRNCH Student Poster Session will be held on Feburary 2nd, 2023 from ~12 to 1:15 PM. We are excited to have a large number of posters from our CRNCH students, and we also are thrilled to be able to feature the work of some of our [CRNCH PhD Fellowship winners](https://crnch.gatech.edu/content/crnch-fellowship).

We note that in some cases, we have not linked posters due to work being under submission or at the presenter's request.

## Student Abstracts:

<a id="ep">**Elton Pinto, Austin Adams - "Neko: A quantum map-filter-reduce programming language"**</a>

Programming quantum computers is hard. One has to painstakingly write code that builds a circuit using low-level quantum gates. In a way, writing a quantum program is analogous to writing assembly: it is tedious, error-prone, and hard to debug. The gate-level abstraction, albeit universal, is non-intuitive and too primitive to be used for rapidly prototyping large-scale quantum applications. There is a need to develop high-level abstractions that enable programmers to productively leverage the idiosyncrasies of quantum computing: quantum parallelism, interference, and entanglement.

In this ongoing work, I present Neko, a high-level quantum programming language that exposes a map-filter-reduce interface for exploiting quantum parallelism through the notion of first-class superpositions.

CuPBoP is an open source framework, which supports executing CUDA on non-NVIDIA devices. Currently, we are working on supporting CUDA on CPUs, Vortex GPUs, AMD GPUs, and Intel GPUs. By supporting CUDA on non-NVIDIA devices, we can support Single-Kernel-Multiple-Device execution on heterogeneous systems.
