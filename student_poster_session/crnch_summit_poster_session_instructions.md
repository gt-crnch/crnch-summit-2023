# CRNCH Summit Poster Session - 2023
 
The CRNCH Summit will take place in person in the Marcus NanoTechnology Building on February 2nd and 3rd. The poster session will run during lunch on February 2nd from 12 PM to 1:15 PM and posters will be up all day Thursday. We also plan to feature poster PDFs on our digital site for those of you who give permission to do so.

## Poster Submission Instructions

To present a poster we ask you to do the following:

3)  Bring you poster to the summit registration desk by 11 AM on Thursday, February 2nd.

## Printing your poster

**NOTE**: We are asking you to please print and bring your poster Thursday morning by 11 AM. Foam posterboard (size 30x40) and easels will be provided for all presenters.

[GT Library Poster Request and Instructions](https://www.library.gatech.edu/poster-request) 

* Each student should have a set amount of pay-for-print funds that can be used to print at the library. 
    * [See this ServiceNow entry for more information on printing](https://gatech.service-now.com/home?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0027983)  
    * Please let us know at captain@crnch.gatech.edu if this poses a financial burden or if you have run out of PFP funds for the semester.
* Please print a 24x36 (height x width for horizontal) poster in matte finish. This will ensure that your poster fits on the posterboad.
    * You are welcome to do a horizontal or vertical poster, based on your content. Unfortunately we only have a horizontal template in our Dropbox link above. 

## Bringing your Poster to the Summit

Please either drop off your poster when you check in Thursday morning or by 11 AM on Thursday so that we have time to set all the posters up. The poster session will run during lunch, and posters should remain up for the afternoon break. Please plan to have at least one person near your poster during lunch. 

## Online Posting of Your Poster PDF and Abstract

If you have given us permission, we will post your PDF poster, title and abstract on our archival site at https://github.com/gt-crnch/crnch-summit-2023. Our intention is to create a DOI that you can use to cite this poster presentation, if desired. 

We will use your responses from the submitted form to determine whether to post your poster-related information. You can select to 1) Share your poster PDF and abstract, 2) Only share the poster title but no abstract or PDF, or 3) Only present your poster in person without sharing any information about it online in the agenda.
